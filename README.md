# My SleepOutside Portfolio

# Overview

Welcome to my SleepOutside Portfolio! This repository contains the project "SleepOutside" which I've worked on over the course of this semester.

## Description

The SleepOutside website is a web application developed as part of a team project for the WDD 330 course. Use this as a starting point to complete the WDD 330 team activity: the SleepOutside web application. It scaffolds out a simple web app with Vite support to bundle up our assets.

## Prerequisites

- You must have Node installed. visit https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/lesson01/l01-software.html and skip to the Node section for instructions

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run start` starts up a local server and updates on any JS or CSS/SCSS changes.

## Other commands

- `npm run build` to build final files when you are ready to turn in.
- `npm run lint` to run ESLint against your code to find errors.
- `npm run format` to run Prettier to automatically format your code.

## Team Collaboration 

Our team used Trello to manage tasks and collaborate on the "SleepOutside" project. I've given the link to the Trello Board as well as my video showcasing the website in the comment of my submission.
